Tries to make it easy to run commands from Docker images.

Right now we only support Linux (macOS probably works, Windows will not as we create symlinks).

$ wget https://github.com/alexpdp7/cmdocker/releases/latest/download/cmdocker -O ~/.local/bin/cmdocker  # or some other directory in your $PATH you can write to
$ chmod +x ~/.local/bin/cmdocker
$ cmdocker add-wrapper busy_touch /bin/touch busybox
Creating "/home/user/.local/bin/busy_touch" as symlink to "/home/user/.local/bin/cmdocker"
$ busy_touch ~/foo bar  # will work with any absolute or relative path inside $HOME
